### Question 1
```{r Question 1}

##Code Bupropion 0 is No, x>0 is Yes
dat$Bupdat <- as.factor(with(dat,ifelse(Bupropion == 0, 'No', 'Yes')))

##Check to make sure still have same number of observations
summary(dat$Bupdat)                 

##Plotting
q1 <- ggplot(data = dat, mapping = aes(y = AGE , x = Bupdat))
q1 + geom_boxplot()
q1 + geom_violin()

```



### Question 2

It is not appropriate to compare the average age of subjects between those who use and don't use Bupriopion.
There were over 90k "no" and only 1400 "yes." Reviewing the boxplot and the violin plot shows similar averages, however the variation in the "no is heavily biased with the large number of outliers in the upper end, pulling the average higher than it might be if they were excluded.

### Question 4



  The question 3 graph shows the proportion of cocaine only substance abuse disorder amongst substance use disorders. The denominator incorporates the use of amphetamines, cocaine, and those who use both amphetamines and cocaine. The graph shows that cocaine use disorder as a proportion of substance disorders has decreased since 2009 across all age groups with a slight rise in adolescents. Given the increase in prescription drug use (1) the decrease in proportional "cocaine only"" use is likely due to the changing landscape of substance use.
  
  Most adolescents start using marijuana first (3) then prescription drug use, this conflicts with the Q3 graph which would indicate that abuse is high in cocaine, but most research focuses on the population as a whole as a result likely skewing the findings. The Truven dataset covers only about 50% of the population as a result those who are particularly disadvantaged are not represented and the demographics and behavior of initial drug use are likely to be skewed. Cocaine use disorder accounts for almost 50% of substance abuse disorders according to the graph, but the other portion covers cocaine use and amphetamine as well as amphetamine alone. The high use of cocaine is what is not consistent.   
  
  Distinguishing between the young adult and adult population can be difficult at times. However, Schulte (4) reported that young adults had the highest rates of medical emergencies due to drug use in comparison to other groups due to marijuana,a heroin, and amphetamines.SAMHSA showed that heroin was used significantly more often than cocaine (2) conflicting with the proportions found, it also showed a stabilizing rate of use which has been corroborated in other reporting (1), (3), (4). The adult population proportional cocaine use seems similar, with significantly lower cocaine use rates than seen here and a more stabilized rate overall. Overall use rates can not be determined as the graph shows proportional to overall substance use, but the downuse use trend is fairly consistent. 

  Overall, the trend downwards for cocaine use is similar to other reports (3), but the proportion does not seem to be accurately representative although it should be noted that the Truven set only has approximately 50% of the population so generalizability is limited. The Truven data and the question 3 graph focused on amphetamines compared to cocaine so making inferences about proportional comparison must be taken judiciously, but the overall trend downwards is accurate. Given that the graph focuses on comparing amphetamine to cocaine use the findings may balance out if other substance use disorders were incorporated into the comparison. The proportional usage does not seem consistent with national averages as cocaine is consistently significantly lower in other research findings.
